# StructureBiasesNicheSDM
This project looks at the effects of correlations between a spatial sampling bias and a species' environmental niche on the performance of species distribution models. Virtual species are simulated as a function of environmental variables with spatial autocorrelation operating at different spatial scales. Virtual sampling occurred either randomly or based on spatially biased surfaces generated with either positive, negative, or neutral correlations to the variables used to define the speciesâ€™ niches. Virtual samples are then used to model species distributions, with models evaluated based on their ability to correctly rank the suitability of sites.
